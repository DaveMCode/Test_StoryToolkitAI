# StoryToolkitAI

## Description

This is meant as an editing extension for Davinci Resolve. 

Among other things, it transcribes timelines directly from Resolve by rendering to Audio Only (mp4/wav) and then passing the rendered file to OpenAI Whisper, a state of the art speech recognition model. 

After the audio files are processed, the tool saves the transcription into both a detailed JSON and an SRT file ready to be imported in Davinci Resolve (or other software).

### Is it really completely free?
Yes, the tool runs locally and there's no need for any additional account.

### Results
The results we get with Whisper are significantly better than any other Speech-to-Text model (including Google, AWS etc.) out there and the models are free to use.

### Speed
Our tests show that on an Macbook Pro M1 a 30 second timeline is transcribed on average in approx. 1 minute, but results may vary.

On a Windows workstation with a GTX1070, the transcription time is around a quarter of the length of the audio file (4 minute audio is transcribed in approx. 1 minute).

## Setup

Our installation is on MacOS 12.6 running on M1, but the scripts should run fine on other CPU and GPUs. For both production and development we're currently using Python 3.9.13. 

_Note: Whisper worked fine on Python 3.10.2, but we ran into problems when trying to install some packages which we're planning to use for future developments._

**The tool only works on Resolve Studio 18.**

_Note: Unfortunately, only the Studio version of Resolve supports external scripting and Resolve versions earlier than 18 do not support Python 3.6+_

We recommend running the tool inside a virtual environment like virtualenv. This is not required, but it prevents messing up your Python installation.

To install OpenAI Whisper, make sure that you have **ffmpeg** installed and then run this:

    pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git 

For more info regarding Whisper installation, please check https://github.com/openai/whisper 

Once Whisper is installed, make sure you have all other requirements installed by running:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you are running the tool on a machine with an NVIDIA CUDA GPU, make sure you install Torch with CUDA:

    pip uninstall torch
    pip cache purge
    install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116

_Note: If Resolve is not turned on or not available, the transcription and translation functions will work on normal wav 
files too. Simply press the transcribe or translate buttons and follow the process._

## How to transcribe timelines:

### 1. Open Resolve
Open a project in Resolve. Then, go back to the folder where you downloaded the tool and run:
    
    python app.py

A simple GUI should appear on screen:

### 2. Open the Timeline and Press Transcribe 

Go back to Resolve and open the Timeline that you want to transcribe, then click the "Transcribe Timeline" button and follow the process from there.

### 3. Wait a bit

Once the process has started, it needs a bit of time to transcribe. As soon as it's done, it will save an SRT with the transcription and a JSON with the full result generated by Whisper.

### 4. Import SRT into Resolve (optional)
When the transcription is ready, you can choose a Media Bin in Resolve where the app will automatically import the generated SRT file.

## Direct Translations to English
The tool also supports direct translation to English by clicking the "Translate Timeline to English" button. However, it will not generate any original language transcription together with the translation.

# Known issues
There seems to be a problem with the Resolve libraries on some Windows 10 machines, but we're trying to find a fix.
If you're running the tool on a Windows 10 machine with Resolve 18 and it works, please get in touch.

# Contributions
This tool is developed and maintained by Octavian Mot (https://mots.us).

Feel free to get in touch or contribute.

The app is very raw and not polished at all!

Ideally it should evolve by incorporating other machine learning models such as CLIP and GPT-3 to assist editors in their work.
