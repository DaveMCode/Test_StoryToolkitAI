# StoryToolkitAI Installation Instructions

[Click here to the main project page](https://github.com/octimot/StoryToolkitAI)

## Installing the Standalone version
If you don't want to get your hands dirty with terminal commands, check if there is a release available for your 
platform [here](https://github.com/octimot/StoryToolkitAI/releases).

We do, however, recommend doing your best to install the git version of the tool using the instructions
below. This would allow you to get the latest features and bug fixes as soon as they are released.

### StoryToolkitAI is free but we need your help

The development of Storytoolkit AI depends highly on the support we get from our Patreon community, so
[please consider supporting the development](https://www.patreon.com/StoryToolkitAI) if you find this tool useful
in your work.

## Installing the tool from source (GIT version)

### Quick Info before we start

#### Caution
If you want to try to install from source, please keep in mind that you might end up ruining your computer, 
destroying the Internet, starting AI apocalypse, losing your job, and/or marry your lost non-identical twin by mistake - 
not necessarily in that order and highly unlikely as a result of trying to install this, but still slightly possible. 

Nevertheless, we're not responsible for any of it or anything else that might happen. In a low-chance worst-case 
scenario, some stuff might not work at all on your computer, and you'll need pro help to fix them back.

#### Requirements

Our installations are on MacOS 12.6+ running on M1 and Windows 10 machines in our editing room, 
but the scripts should run fine on other CPUs and GPUs. 
For both production and development we're currently using Python 3.10.11. 

_Note: The tool worked fine on Python 3.9, but some packages are now optimized for Python 3.10. 
Python 3.9 support will no longer be possible in the very near future._

**The Resolve API integration only works on Resolve Studio 18 (not on the free version, and certainly not earlier 
versions).**

#### For Patrons 

_If you have access to the early-updates private repo and don't know how to clone or pull from it, 
message us on Patreon and we'll help you make it work._

## Mac OS

#### 0. Open Terminal

Using Finder, go to the Folder where you want to install StoryToolkitAI.
Right-click on it and select "New Terminal at Folder". 

Once a terminal window opens, go through the following steps.

#### 1. Homebrew will make your life easier:

Install Homebrew:

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

In case Homebrew installation fails, please check [this page](https://docs.brew.sh/Common-Issues) for troubleshooting.

The most common reason why brew installations fail is because Xcode Command Line Tools isn't installed. 
So, install that using `xcode-select --install`.

#### 2. You'll need Python 3.10, Python Tkinter, Git, FFMPEG and Rust:

    brew install python@3.10
    brew install python-tk@3.10
    brew install git
    brew install ffmpeg
    brew install rust

#### 3. Download StoryToolkitAI:

Download from GitHub using this command:

    git clone https://github.com/octimot/StoryToolkitAI.git

This should download the app in the folder that you chose.

#### 4. Set up a virtual environment
We recommend running the tool inside a virtual environment like virtualenv. This is not required, but it prevents
messing up your Python installation.

First, create a virtual environment:

    python3.10 -m venv venv

Right now, your installation folder should contain 2 other folders, and the tree should look like this:

    YOUR_INSTALLATION_FOLDER
    +- StoryToolkitAI
    +- venv

#### 5. Activate virtual environment
Now enable the virtual environment (this means that all the packages you'll install now via pip will be contained in the
virtual environment, meaning that for the tool to work you'll ALWAYS have to activate the virtual environment first
using the following command!)

From the installation folder, run:

    source venv/bin/activate

#### 6. Install OpenAI Whisper
_Note: starting with step 7, you need to make sure that you are installing packages inside the virtual environment. 
If you followed the previous steps, your terminal prompt should now have `(venv)` before everything else._

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git@ba3f3cd54b0e5b8ce1ab3de13e32122d0d5f98ab

For more info regarding Whisper installation, please check https://github.com/openai/whisper

#### 7. Install all the stuff the tool requires:
_Note: starting with step 7, you need to make sure that you are installing packages inside the virtual environment. 
If you followed the previous steps, your terminal prompt should now have `(venv)` before everything else._

    pip install -r StoryToolkitAI/requirements.txt

If you are running the tool on a machine with an NVIDIA CUDA GPU, make sure you install Torch with CUDA:

    pip uninstall torch
    pip cache purge
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

#### That's it!
Inside the virtual environment, you should now be able to start the tool:

    python StoryToolkitAI/storytoolkitai

_Note: If you restart your machine or open a new terminal window, you need to activate the virtual environment again
before starting the app._ In the installation folder, run:

    source venv/bin/activate
    
## Windows

#### 0. Open Command Prompt
First, create the folder where you want to install StoryToolkitAI. 
Then, open the Command Prompt and navigate to that folder - with Windows Explorer open in the installation folder,
type in `cmd` in the location bar above then press Enter, and your Command Prompt should start directly in the
installation folder.

#### 1. Download and install Python
Download the latest Python 3.10 version from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

_Note: Do not use the Python installers available from the Windows Store. Only use other Python installers / versions
if you know what you're doing._

Then simply install it on your machine using the default settings.

To check if you installed the right version, open the Command Prompt and run:

    py --version

Something like `Python 3.10.11` should appear. Anything else besides 3.10.X means that you're in uncharted
territories! If that is the case, we recommend uninstalling all Python versions (if you don't need them of course)
and reinstalling Python 3.10.

#### 2. Download and install GIT for Windows

Download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and then install it.

#### 3. Install virtualenv

We recommend running the tool inside a virtual environment like virtualenv. This is not required, but it prevents
messing up your Python installation, for that, you need to install virtualenv.

If you installed Python according to step 1, this shouldn't be necessary. But to make sure that you have virtualenv,
simply run:

    py -3.10 -m pip install virtualenv

#### 4. Download and install FFMPEG via Chocolatey
The simplest way to install FFMPEG on windows is to use a package manager like [Choco](https://chocolatey.org/install), 
but feel free to skip this step if you already have FFMPEG or if you know of a better way to install it.

Open PowerShell as Admin, and run:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

If you're running into issues please read the [Choco installation guide](https://chocolatey.org/install).

Once Choco is installed, you can install FFMPEG using this command:

    choco install ffmpeg

#### 5. Download StoryToolkitAI:

Open the Command Prompt and navigate to the folder where you want to install StoryToolkitAI. Then run:

    git clone https://github.com/octimot/StoryToolkitAI.git

#### 6. Set up a virtual environment
Now create a virtual environment (to prevent messing up with other python packages you may have installed on your OS
for other stuff):

    py -3.10 -m virtualenv venv

Right now, your installation folder should contain 2 other folders, and the tree should look like this:
    
    YOUR_INSTALLATION_FOLDER
    +- StoryToolkitAI
    +- venv

#### 7. Activate virtual environment
Now enable the virtual environment (this means that all the packages you'll install now via pip will be contained in the
virtual environment, meaning that for the tool to work **you'll ALWAYS have to activate the virtual environment first**
using the following command!)

From your installation folder, run:

    StoryToolkitAI\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

#### 8. Install OpenAI Whisper
Note: starting with step 7, you need to make sure that you are installing packages inside the virtual environment. If you followed the previous steps, your terminal prompt should now have (venv) before everything else.

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git@ba3f3cd54b0e5b8ce1ab3de13e32122d0d5f98ab

For more info regarding Whisper installation, please check https://github.com/openai/whisper

#### 9. Install all the stuff the tool requires:
Note: starting with step 7, you need to make sure that you are installing packages inside the virtual environment. 
If you followed the previous steps, your terminal prompt should now have (venv) before everything else.

    pip install -r StoryToolkitAI\requirements.txt

If you are running the tool on a machine with an NVIDIA CUDA GPU, make sure you install Torch with CUDA:
    
    pip uninstall torch torchaudio torchvision
    pip cache purge
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

_Note: If Resolve Studio is not turned on or not available, the transcription and translation functions will work on 
normal wav files too. Simply press the transcribe or translate buttons and follow the process._

#### That's it!
Inside the virtual environment, you should now be able to start the tool from the installation folder:

    py StoryToolkitAI\storytoolkitai

_Note: If you restart your machine or open a new terminal window, you need to activate the virtual environment again
before starting the app._ In the installation folder, run:

    StoryToolkitAI\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

## Running the git version

From your installation folder, run:

### On windows:

    StoryToolkitAI\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    py StoryToolkitAI\storytoolkitai

### On Mac OS:

    source venv/bin/activate
    python StoryToolkitAI/storytoolkitai

The tool should pop up now on the screen
